## Flying without Wings

Ceria, terakhir kali kamu mengirimkan video kamu menyanyi, yaitu "Flying without Wings"
I love that. I love everything about that. 
Someday, can I pray that you're gonna sing again for me?

"So, impossible as it may seem
You've got to fight for every dream
'Cause who's to know which one you let go
Would have made you complete (Oh)"

"And you're the place my life begins
And you'll be where it ends
I'm flying without wings
And that's the joy you bring
I'm flying without wings"
Aku ingin meng-amin-kan ini semua Ceria. Apakah tidak apa-apa?
I want to end all of the day with your smile.
