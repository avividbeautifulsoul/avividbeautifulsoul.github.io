## Please, I'm Not Vampire

I wish I can say that I would never be your vampire. 
Ceria, I don't want to be your vampire.

"Hate to give the satisfaction, asking how you're doing now
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?"
Ceria, I never pretend to care about people, especially you. I swear to God, I care a lot about you.
I am sorry that I'm poorly made. I'm really sorry

"Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes"
What party? What do you mean by party, Ceria? I'm miserable and somehow, I want you to know.
Maybe, I wish that I want to be saved by you. Like all the time you save me?

"Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
Gotta laugh at the stupidity"
Ceria, do you think that I torture you? That I manipulate you?
Dear God, I love you, I do love you. I'm sorry that I do not make that clear, Ceria.

"Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, famefucker
Bleedin' me dry, like a goddamn vampire"
If you think that I'm vampire that suck everything from you,
if you feel that I'm sold all of you, I'm sorry, Ceria.
I am sorry.

"And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called them crazy too
You're so convincing
"How do you lie without flinching?
Ooh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked-up little thrill"
Ceria, do you think I lied? Everything I do is lie?
No, Ceria, no.

"You said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard?
You can't love anyone, 'cause that would mean you had a heart
I tried you help you out, now I know that I can't
'Cause how you think's the kind of thing I'll never understand
I'm sorry that I'm poorly made Ceria. I'm so sorry
