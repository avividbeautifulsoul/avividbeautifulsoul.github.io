## And I Hurt you (Again)

I promise that I love you. Everything I am, everything I have, is yours, Ceria.
But, I feel that everything is so heavy. I feel that I am not ready.

I am at the worst place in the world. I hate that I am far away from you.
You cannot imagine how many times I check the flight ticket, just to go to back, just to have a hug from you.
I miss everything about you, your voice, your smell, your presence and more importantly, your heart. 
However, I am weak, I am stupid and and I do not deserve anything from you Ceria, I am sorry.

I am sorry that I ask to be alone because I do not know what should I do. I am sorry that I hurt you so much, it changes you.
I always know that you are the most kind and pure person and I hurt you again. Dear God, what I have done Ceria?
I am sorry, I am sorry.
