## Last time in Airport

Well, now I'm 1500km away from you. I'm literally on the other side of the world.
It's okay. I mean, you're gonna be okay. You are the strongest person on earth.
But, maybe I'm not okay? Last time in airport, I'm kinda little bit angry with you because you're in the front of gate
and someoone want to passing through. I'm afraid that you're gonna make her angry. But, I really regret our last moment like that
I'm sorry. That should not be the way we separated. Next time we meet again, I will hug and never let you go.
We will board the plane together and I will follow you wherever you want.
