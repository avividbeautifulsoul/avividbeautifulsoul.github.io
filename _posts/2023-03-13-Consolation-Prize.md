## Consolation Prize

Dear Ceria,

I know and I believe that you care so much for me. Sometimes, I still believe that we mean for each other.
We just don't know when it would happen, but still, I believe in that.
Of course, there is a time when I stop believe in that. Simply, because I know you had already make decision.
If I remember that, of course it hurts. How you already make so many plan and Dear God, I wish I never knew.

I care so much about you and I want to be with you all the time Ceria. Sometimes I wonder, what if I am just consolation prize?
That I just something that becomes you consolation? But, you know. I do not care about that Ceria. I do not care if I am you consolation prize.
I will be whatever you need to be. As long as I am with you, I think everything's gonna be okay, Ceria.
