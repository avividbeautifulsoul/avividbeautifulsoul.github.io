## I Do Not Deserve You

I am fail at everything. Academic, family and my love life. The dream to become lecturer seems to big for ordinary person like me. 
For love? The one that I love did not deserve with failure like me. I'm drowning and It is hard to catch a breath. Please help me.

I want to ask for your help, but I can't, why you ask? Because I'm afraid that you're gonna leave me. That someday you will realize that you falling for the wrong person.
That you deserve someone better, mature, and smarter. Meanwhile, I will be alone in this world and that's okay because someone that hate himself as much as me deserve to be alone at the first place.
Maybe it is better to be alone, so you can be happy with other person?

Please don't go. Please.
