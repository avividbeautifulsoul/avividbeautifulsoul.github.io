## Red Shoes

Do you remember the night we're dancing Red Shoes by IU? I just moved my body and you look so happy.
I remember your eyes. You try to focus, but also enjoy your time. It's like you're effortless to feel happy.

Is it okay if I said that you're also happy because of me? Am I asking too much?
Can we dance together till the end of time?
