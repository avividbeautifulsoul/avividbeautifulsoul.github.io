## Little Thing for Your Birthday

Hi Dearest,

Selamat ulang tahun. I made something special for you. A cut scene from every movies and series
that makes me remember you, all the time. You means a lot. 
But, funny thing is, I never have courage to send it to you. I don't know why.

What if I'm messed up? So, you know that I have a romantic feeling for you. That I want to be with you, all the time.
But, what if I lost you forever, because I will hurt you?
That's the burden that I cannot bear, Ceria.

I believe we never have any intention to hurt each other. Sometimes in life, the decision that we made can lead to another painful event that we do not wanna bear.
I'm sorry that I such a mess.
